# WeatherReport
In this project I am implementing a weather API using python. I used various dependencies such as tkinter, requests, and datetime. To do this, I used the get method from HTTP in RESTful API development and stored the request into a response variable. 

app.py and link.py obtain the API key from secrets.py to keep the key confidential. I used JSON as the data formatter because it is easy-to-parse and read.

Currently, my WeatherReport program can do the following functions: 
- Returns temperature of any city in Fahrenheit 
- Returns the country 
- Displays date & time 
- Displays weather description 
- Displays wind speed 
- Displays humidity 
- Displays pressure

link.py shows a terminal representation of the data
app.py shows a visual GUI representation of the data

In the future, I plan to add the following features to this WeatherReport Program:
- Adding the temperature of the next day 
- Adding visuals to describe the weather 
- Adding more buttons such as converting from farenheit to celcius
